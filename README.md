# Welcome to Python Fundamentals! #

This repository holds the examples for the YouTube course [Python Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4DfT1CdxInGGiYHxlszhbbN1dBzDacZ8). The examples are organized by lesson, with each lesson getting its own folder.

## Prereqs ##

In order to use the examples in this repo, you must have the ability to run Python code on your computer. You can install Python locally or use a web-based tool, which the first three videos in this course cover.

In addition, you should have some familiarity with Python. If you've found this without having learned Python before, these examples do not completely cover the content and concepts of the course, instead serving to reinforce the content of the lessons. If you are looking to learn Python, please check out the free course _**and then**_ study the examples.
